					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/build-log-reviung41lp/#comment-12&quot;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt;.

My zmk configs can be found at https://github.com/kitchen/zmk-config

Note that there’s reviung41 and reviung41lp in there and there’s a custom overlay file for the lp that is being included in the build. It’s a bit wonky but it works fine. The idea is that it leverages the reviung41 shield config built in to zmk but uses a different pin out and matrix transform. Honestly it should probably just be a distinct shield but I didn’t know what I was doing at the time and haven’t revisited things.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have the exact same components as you, and I was wondering if you could please send or post on Github your .uf2 file for flashing the nice!nano? The current firmware I have flashed has all the alphas off by a few spaces on the right hand side of the board.]]></description>
