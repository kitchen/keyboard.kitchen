Battery goes on middle, board goes on a side. Or the other way around. Which side doesnâ€™t matter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Can&#039;t really understand how you wired the thing, there&#039;s so much glue. Does the red from the battery go to the center or the sides? Does it matter which side of the switch you use? Or are they just throws and you just pick one]]></description>

Nah it is almost certainly a firmware thing. Since I published this post, zmk has done a bunch of stuff with Bluetooth pairing and the mac and itâ€™s been much better now, at least with my other boards. I havenâ€™t used this one in some time :)]]></description>

It should work just fine, yep! But you donâ€™t want to wire the nanos to each other using the trrs, so you might want to take them off or fill them with glue or something.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, kitchen. How are you? I hope you are doing well. So I saw your videos on Youtube, and then I want to turn my Corne Choc into wireless split as well(by replacing my Promicro with nice!nano). I can just take my Promicros off without any issue since I am using conthrough on both of them. Just wondering if I don&#039;t take off the TRRS jack, and just solder my battery straight on my nice!nano, will it sill work?]]></description>

My zmk configs can be found at https://github.com/kitchen/zmk-config

Note that thereâ€™s reviung41 and reviung41lp in there and thereâ€™s a custom overlay file for the lp that is being included in the build. Itâ€™s a bit wonky but it works fine. The idea is that it leverages the reviung41 shield config built in to zmk but uses a different pin out and matrix transform. Honestly it should probably just be a distinct shield but I didnâ€™t know what I was doing at the time and havenâ€™t revisited things.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have the exact same components as you, and I was wondering if you could please send or post on Github your .uf2 file for flashing the nice!nano? The current firmware I have flashed has all the alphas off by a few spaces on the right hand side of the board.]]></description>
